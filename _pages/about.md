Welcome! I am Pablo Argote, PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. My research lies at the intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Economy, with a regional focus on Latin America. One strand looks at how politicians adopt strategies in respond to changes in electoral laws, shocks in the electorate and alterations in the informational environment. Indeed, my dissertation analyzes how exposure to social media affects elite resposiveness in Chile, exploiting a sudden change in consumption of Facebook and Twitter. 

A second strand explores how sudden demographic changes affects attitudes and voting behavior. I study these topics using a variety of quantitative methods, including experiments, quasi-experimental designs and text analysis, always prioritizing causal identification. My research has been published in the European Political Science Review, the Journal of Politics in Latin America, and in Nature Partner Journal Vaccines.  

Before my PhD, I worked in the Chilean government, in a political campaign and I did a Master in Public Administration at NYU.
