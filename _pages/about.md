Welcome! I am Pablo Argote, Provost Postdoctoral Scholar in the Political Science Department at the University of Southern California. I study comparative political behavior with a regional focus on Latin America.

My research explores different factors affecting political behavior and attitudes, including exposure to immigration, access to the Internet, access to social media, and state indoctrination. More specifically, I am currently researching 
the role of ideology versus issues in electoral preferences, the impact of south-south migration on political attitudes, and the effect of access to the internet on attitudes towards abortion. I use various quantitative methods, including experiments, quasi-experimental designs with observational data, and text analysis, always prioritizing causal identification. My research has been published in Plos One, the European Political Science Review, the Journal of Politics in Latin America, and Nature Partner Journal Vaccines, among others.

Before my PhD at Columbia University, I worked in the Chilean government, in a political campaign and completed a Master's in Public Administration.
