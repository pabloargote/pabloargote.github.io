Welcome! I am Pablo Argote, PhD Candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. Broadly speaking, my research lies at the intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Economy, with a regional focus on Latin America. One strand of my research looks at how politicians adopt strategies in respond to changes in electoral laws, shocks in the electorate and alterations in the informational environment. Indeed, my dissertation looks at how exposure to social media affects elite resposiveness in Chile, exploiting a sudden change in consumption of Facebook and Twitter. A second strand of my research explores how sudden demographic changes ---caused by the great Venezuelan migration--- affects attitudes and voting behavior. My research has been published in the European Political Science Review, the Journal of Politics in Latin America, and in Nature Partner Journal Vaccines.
