Welcome! I am Pablo Argote, Provost Postdoctoral Scholar in the Political Science Department at the University of Southern California. I study comparative political behavior with a regional focus on Latin America.

My research explores different factors affecting political behavior, ideology and attitudes, including exposure to immigration, elections, state indoctrination and access to the Internet. Currently, I am researching about ideology, south-south migration, individualistic attitudes and ideological gender gaps. I use various quantitative methods: experiments, quasi-experiments with observational data, and text analysis, always prioritizing causal identification. My research has been published in Comparative Political Studies, Plos One, the European Political Science Review, International Interactions, and Nature Partner Journal Vaccines, among others.

Before my PhD at Columbia University, I worked in the Chilean government, in a political campaign and completed a Master's in Public Administration.
