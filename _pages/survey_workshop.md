## Survey Research Workshop Spring 2026

### Organizers: Pablo Argote and Daniela Urbina

Survey data is available everywhere. However, we should not take for granted that it is always high-quality, representative, or reliable. In fact, the current flurry of data sources and AI tools makes it more important than ever to have the skills to judge the quality of the measures we use, and to work with survey data rigorously to answer substantive research questions. This workshop has three goals:

1. Learn core statistical and practical tools to work with existing survey data or to design a new survey from scratch. These include building post-stratification weights, implementing multiple regression and post-stratification (MRP), using Qualtrics, designing appropriate survey questions, and designing and analyzing survey experiments, among others.

2. Provide a platform for graduate students, postdocs, and assistant professors to present ongoing work and receive feedback from an expert audience.

3. Create a network of social scientists at USC who work with survey data, facilitating the sharing of skills, practical knowledge, and contacts in the survey research world.

The audience of this workshop are mostly USC graduate students from Political Science, Sociology or other departmetns in the social sciences. As the workshop has a "how-to" component, it could be especially helpful for students who lack practical skills in this area, but who wish to use survey data in their dissertation. 

In the coming days, we will provide a link for people to register, and a tentative schedule of the first 3 sessions.
